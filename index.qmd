Maternal Vaccination in the United States

:::

The goal of this dashboard is to provide a clear, approachable view of vaccination coverage among pregnant women in the United States. Using survey data from the CDC Pregnancy Vaccination Surveillance System, the site focuses on how coverage for recommended vaccines varies across time, geography, and demographic groups.

## Snapshot of the Dataset {.section-title}

::: callout
This dashboard uses the dataset **“Vaccination Coverage among Pregnant Women”**, which contains **4,798 observations** collected from **2012–2022**. Each row represents a combination of vaccine, geographic unit, survey year, and demographic group, with a coverage percentage, 95% confidence interval, and sample size.

These measures provide a consistent basis for comparing maternal vaccination patterns.

The dataset includes individuals who were pregnant during each survey year. Coverage estimates are available for **Influenza** and **Tdap**, reported at both **national** and **state** levels.

Demographic groups include race/ethnicity, age, and indicators of healthcare access, allowing patterns and disparities in maternal vaccination to be examined.
