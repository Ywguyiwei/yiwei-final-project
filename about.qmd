### 📌 Conclusion

Key takeaways:

::: methods-callout
-   **Tdap vaccination coverage has increased substantially over time**, stabilizing at consistently higher levels than influenza.\
-   **Influenza coverage remains lower and more variable**, likely reflecting seasonal timing and differences in how flu vaccines are delivered in prenatal care.\
-   **Disparities are evident across race/ethnicity and insurance status**, with Black, non-Hispanic pregnant individuals showing persistently lower coverage.\
-   **State participation varies**, and non-reporting states limit full geographic comparison.\
-   **Overall, maternal vaccination uptake remains uneven**, highlighting opportunities to improve access, strengthen provider recommendations, and reduce inequities.

These findings help identify where progress is strong and where targeted public health efforts are still needed.
