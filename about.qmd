### 📌 Key takeaways:

::: methods-callout
-   **Tdap coverage rose quickly after 2012 and remains high**, indicating strong adoption in prenatal care.

-   **Influenza coverage is consistently lower and more variable**, with a slight decline after 2020.

-   **Disparities persist**: Black, Non-Hispanic individuals and younger pregnant women show the lowest uptake.

-   **Missing state data limits national estimates**, as PRAMS participation varies and many states do not report each year.

**Overall, Tdap uptake is strong and stable, while influenza vaccination continues to lag and remains less equitable. These findings help identify where progress is strong and where targeted oublich health efforts are still needed.**
