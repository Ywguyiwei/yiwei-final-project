    "text": "📌 Data preparation\nThe dataset used in this project was obtained from the CDC Pregnancy Vaccination Surveillance System, which provides estimates of maternal vaccination coverage in the United States. The data were downloaded as a CSV file and imported into R for cleaning and analysis.\nTo prepare the dataset, variable names were standardized to lowercase and formatted for clarity (e.g., Survey Year/Influenza Season → year). Coverage estimates were converted to numeric values, and confidence interval fields were preserved in their original text form. The dataset includes information on vaccine type (Influenza or Tdap), geographic unit (national or state), survey year, demographic subgroup, and estimated vaccination coverage.\nNo unformatted console output (such as head(), str(), or raw print statements) is included in this report. Instead, dataset characteristics are summarized using formatted tables to ensure readability and professional presentation.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggprism)\nlibrary(sf)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nvacc_raw &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/Vaccination_Coverage_among_Pregnant_Women_20251202.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncolnames(vacc_raw)\n\n\n[1] \"Vaccine\"                      \"Geography Type\"              \n[3] \"Geography\"                    \"Survey Year/Influenza Season\"\n[5] \"Dimension Type\"               \"Dimension\"                   \n[7] \"Estimate (%)\"                 \"95% CI (%)\"                  \n[9] \"Sample Size\"                 \n\n\n\n\nCode\n vacc_clean &lt;- vacc_raw |&gt;\n  dplyr::rename(\n    vaccine         = Vaccine,\n    geography_type  = `Geography Type`,\n    geography       = Geography,\n    year            = `Survey Year/Influenza Season`,\n    dimension_type  = `Dimension Type`,\n    dimension       = Dimension,\n    estimate        = `Estimate (%)`,\n    ci              = `95% CI (%)`,\n    sample_size     = `Sample Size`\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    year        = as.integer(year),\n    estimate    = as.numeric(estimate),\n    sample_size = as.integer(sample_size),\n    vaccine        = factor(vaccine),\n    geography_type = factor(geography_type),\n    dimension_type = factor(dimension_type)\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(\n    !is.na(estimate),\n    !is.na(sample_size),\n    !is.na(year)\n  )\n\n\nWarning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.\nℹ In argument: `estimate = as.numeric(estimate)`.\nCaused by warning:\n!
