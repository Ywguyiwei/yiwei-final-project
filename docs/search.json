The data were downloaded as a CSV file and imported into R for cleaning and analysis.\nTo prepare the dataset, variable names were standardized to lowercase and formatted for clarity (e.g., Survey Year/Influenza Season → year). Coverage estimates were converted to numeric values, and confidence interval fields were preserved in their original text form. The dataset includes information on vaccine type (Influenza or Tdap), geographic unit (national or state), survey year, demographic subgroup, and estimated vaccination coverage.\nNo unformatted console output (such as head(), str(), or raw print statements) is included in this report. Instead, dataset characteristics are summarized using formatted tables to ensure readability and professional presentation.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggprism)\nlibrary(sf)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nvacc_raw &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/Vaccination_Coverage_among_Pregnant_Women_20251202.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"Vaccine\"                      \"Geography Type\"              \n[3] \"Geography\"                    \"Survey Year/Influenza Season\"\n[5] \"Dimension Type\"               \"Dimension\"                   \n[7] \"Estimate (%)\"                 \"95% CI (%)\"                  \n[9] \"Sample Size\"                 \n\n\n\nColumn Names in vacc_raw\n\n\nColumns\n\n\n\n\nVaccine\n\n\nGeography Type\n\n\nGeography\n\n\nSurvey Year/Influenza Season\n\n\nDimension Type\n\n\nDimension\n\n\nEstimate (%)\n\n\n95% CI (%)\n\n\nSample Size\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n vacc_clean &lt;- vacc_raw |&gt;\n  dplyr::rename(\n    vaccine         = Vaccine,\n    geography_type  = `Geography Type`,\n    geography       = Geography,\n    year            = `Survey Year/Influenza Season`,\n    dimension_type  = `Dimension Type`,\n    dimension       = Dimension,\n    ci              = `95% CI (%)`,\n    sample_size     = `Sample Size`\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    year        = as.integer(year),\n    estimate    = parse_number(`Estimate (%)`),\n    sample_size = as.integer(sample_size),\n    vaccine        = factor(vaccine),\n    geography_type = factor(geography_type),\n    dimension_type = factor(dimension_type)\n  ) \n\n\n\n\nCode\nsum(vacc_raw$`Estimate (%)` %in% c(\"NR\", \"NR*\"))\n\n\n[1] 476\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsum(is.na(vacc_clean$estimate))\n\n\n[1] 476\n\n\nThe raw dataset has 476 NR (not reported).

The distribution is roughly bell-shaped, indicating that most observations fall near the middle rather than at the extremes.\nThe dashed vertical line marks the mean state-level vaccination coverage, which is around 60%. A large concentration of states appears just above and below this average, suggesting moderate variability across states but no extreme outliers. Lower coverage values (&lt;30%) and very high values (&gt;80%) occur rarely.\nOverall, the plot indicates that while vaccination coverage varies, most states achieve influenza vaccination rates within a relatively consistent mid-range.\n\nTdap:\n\n\n\nCode\nvacc_state &lt;- vacc_clean %&gt;%\n  filter(geography_type == \"States\")\n\ntdap_state &lt;- vacc_state %&gt;%\n  filter(vaccine == \"Tdap\")\nggplot(na.omit(tdap_state), aes(x = estimate)) +\n  geom_histogram(\n    bins = 20,\n    fill = \"#E15759\",\n    color = \"white\",\n    linewidth = 0.2,\n    alpha = 0.9\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(\n    xintercept = mean(tdap_state$estimate, na.rm = TRUE),\n    linetype = \"dashed\",\n    linewidth = 0.7\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of State-Level Tdap Vaccination Coverage\",\n    x = \"Coverage (%)\",\n    y = \"Number of States\"\n  ) +\n  theme_prism(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis histogram displays the distribution of Tdap vaccination coverage among U.S. states across all years in the dataset. Coverage values range broadly, from below 10% in some early years to nearly 100% in later years. The distribution is noticeably right-shifted, indicating that Tdap vaccination rates are generally higher than influenza vaccination rates across states. A large concentration of observations falls between 65% and 85%, and the mean coverage (indicated by the dashed line) is roughly 75%. This suggests that most states achieve relatively high Tdap vaccination rates among pregnant women. Lower coverage values (&lt;30%) appear only rarely and likely represent older survey years when Tdap recommendations for pregnancy were still being established.\nOverall, the distribution shows substantial improvement over time, with the majority of state-level estimates clustered in the upper range of the coverage spectrum.\n\nHow do Influenza and Tdap coverage compare?\n\n\n\nCode\n ggplot(vacc_clean, aes(x = vaccine, y = estimate, fill = vaccine)) +\n  geom_boxplot(\n    outlier.alpha = 0.20, \n    outlier.size  = 1,\n    alpha         = 0.9,\n    na.rm         = TRUE    \n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Influenza vs Tdap Vaccination Coverage\",\n    x = \"Vaccine Type\",\n    y = \"Coverage (%)\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_prism(palette = \"floral\") +\n  theme_prism(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title      = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title.x    = element_text(size = 14),\n    axis.title.y    = element_text(size = 14),\n    axis.text       = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis boxplot compares state-level vaccination coverage for Influenza and Tdap among pregnant women across all survey years. Influenza coverage shows a median around 60%, with values generally ranging from 50% to 70%. The distribution is moderately spread out, and several lower outliers (below 30%) represent early years when influenza vaccination uptake among pregnant women was lower. In contrast, Tdap coverage is noticeably higher, with a median close to 75% and most values falling between 65% and 85%.\nOverall, the comparison highlights that Tdap vaccination coverage is substantially higher and more consistent across states than influenza vaccination coverage.\n\nVaccination Coverage Over Time\n\n\n\nCode\ntrend &lt;- vacc_clean %&gt;%\n  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %&gt;%   \n  group_by(year) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_coverage = mean(estimate, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nggplot(trend, aes(x = year, y = mean_coverage)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#2C73D2\", linewidth = 1.6) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#FFA500\", size = 3.5) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(40, NA)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(trend$year), max(trend$year), 1)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Maternal Vaccination Coverage Over Time\",\n    x = \"Survey Year\",\n    y = \"Mean Coverage (%)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_prism(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaternal vaccination coverage shows a gradual upward trend from 2012 to around The line plot shows the average maternal vaccination coverage in the United States from 2012 to 2022.

After 2020, coverage declined slightly but remained relatively high, stabilizing around 65–67% in 2021–2022. Each point represents the mean vaccination coverage for that survey year, excluding missing values but retaining them in the dataset. Overall, the trend indicates substantial improvement in maternal vaccination uptake over the past decade, followed by a modest decrease in the most recent years.\n\n\nCode\ntrend_data &lt;- vacc_clean %&gt;%\n  filter(\n    geography_type == \"States\",\n    vaccine %in% c(\"Influenza\", \"Tdap\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n\n  mutate(year4 = stringr::str_extract(year, \"^[0-9]{4}\")) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(year4),\n         year4 &gt;= \"2012\",\n         year4 &lt;= \"2022\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(year4, vaccine) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    mean_coverage = mean(estimate, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    year = factor(year4, levels = as.character(2012:2022))\n  )\n\nggplot(trend_data, aes(x = year, y = mean_coverage, color = vaccine, group = vaccine)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.4) +\n  geom_point(size = 2.8) +\n  scale_color_prism(palette = \"floral\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Vaccination Trends Over Time (2012–2022)\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Average Coverage (%)\",\n    color = \"Vaccine\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE) +\n  theme_prism(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x  = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    plot.title   = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows the average vaccination coverage for Influenza and Tdap among pregnant women in the United States from 2012 to 2022. Influenza coverage begins around 48% in 2012, rises gradually to a peak of about 64–65% by 2019–2020, and then declines modestly after 2020. In contrast, Tdap coverage starts much lower—around 17% in 2012—but increases sharply, reaching more than 70% by 2016 and remaining consistently high (approximately 75–80%) through the rest of the decade. Overall, Tdap shows a rapid and sustained increase, while influenza shows moderate gains followed by a slight decline in recent years.\n\nHow do vaccination rates differ across demographic groups (age & race/ethnicity)?\n\nAge:\n\n\nCode\nage_summary &lt;- vacc_clean %&gt;%\n  filter(\n    dimension_type == \"Age\",\n    vaccine %in% c(\"Influenza\", \"Tdap\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(vaccine, dimension) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    mean_coverage   = mean(estimate, na.rm = TRUE),   \n    median_coverage = median(estimate, na.rm = TRUE), \n    n               = n(),                             \n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\nkable(\n  age_summary,\n  digits = 1,\n  caption = \"Vaccination Coverage by Age Group and Vaccine\"\n)\n\n\n\nVaccination Coverage by Age Group and Vaccine\n\n\nvaccine\ndimension\nmean_coverage\nmedian_coverage\nn\n\n\n\n\nInfluenza\n18-24 Years\n52.2\n52.5\n406\n\n\nInfluenza\n25-34 Years\n60.8\n61.0\n406\n\n\nInfluenza\n&gt;=18 Years\n59.5\n59.8\n406\n\n\nInfluenza\n&gt;=35 Years\n64.0\n64.7\n406\n\n\nTdap\n18-24 Years\n66.1\n71.9\n199\n\n\nTdap\n25-34 Years\n70.0\n76.2\n199\n\n\nTdap\n&gt;=18 Years\n68.9\n75.2\n199\n\n\nTdap\n&gt;=35 Years\n68.8\n72.8\n199\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nage_data &lt;- vacc_clean %&gt;%\n  filter(dimension_type == \"Age\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    estimate = as.numeric(estimate),\n    dimension_clean = case_when(\n      grepl(\"18\", dimension) & grepl(\"24\", dimension) ~ \"18–24\",\n      grepl(\"25\", dimension) & grepl(\"34\", dimension) ~ \"25–34\",\n      grepl(\"35\", dimension)                         ~ \"35+\",\n      grepl(\"≥18\", dimension)                        ~ \"≥18\",\n      TRUE                                           ~ dimension\n    ),\n    dimension_clean = factor(dimension_clean,\n                             levels = c(\"18–24\", \"25–34\", \"35+\",\"≥18\"))\n  )\n\nggplot(age_data, aes(x = dimension_clean, y = estimate)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"#00A9A5\", alpha = 0.85, na.rm = TRUE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Vaccination Coverage Across Age Groups\",\n    x = \"Age Group\",\n    y = \"Coverage (%)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_prism(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot compares vaccination coverage across maternal age groups.

    "text": "EDA:\n\n\nThis analysis uses data from the CDC PRAMS Internet Panel Survey, which reports influenza and Tdap vaccination coverage among pregnant individuals in participating U.S. states.\nCDC “Vaccination Coverage Among Pregnant Women” dataset was imported into R and performing an initial structural review. This included checking the dataset size, inspecting column names, examining variable types, and viewing both the first and last rows to understand how observations were formatted. We then evaluated key variables—such as vaccine type, geography, survey year, demographic dimensions, sample sizes, and reported coverage values—to confirm that they matched expectations based on the CDC documentation.\nNext, the dataset was cleaned and standardized . Reported vaccination estimates contained non-numeric entries such as \"NR\" or \"NR*\", which indicate values that were not reported due to small sample size. These were converted to missing values (NA) using parse_number(), while the original rows were retained so that missingness patterns could be analyzed. Core variables (e.g., year, estimate, sample size) were converted into appropriate numeric formats, and categorical variables were recoded as factors.\nTo understand dataset completeness, we counted the number of missing values, examined which states or years lacked data, and identified that not all U.S. states participate in the CDC’s Internet Panel Surveys. This missingness motivated caution in interpreting national or state-level averages.\ndistributions of key variables were reviewed such as influenza and Tdap coverage, demographic group coverage, and variation across states—to check for skewness, outliers, and data consistency. These exploratory plots allowed us to verify that values fell within reasonable ranges (0–100%) and aligned with CDC-reported national trends.\nBased on this groundwork, a set of core analysis questions was formulated to examine temporal trends in vaccination uptake, differences between influenza and Tdap coverage, and disparities across demographic groups. Initial exploration involved generating simple visual summaries—including histograms, boxplots, and trend lines—to identify major patterns in the data. Once these preliminary results appeared consistent with expectations, the analyses were refined through the use of sample-size–weighted averages, enhanced visualization design, and comparison against publicly reported CDC estimates to ensure accuracy and coherence\n\n\n\n\n\nState participation varies annually, and some states contribute no data at all. In 2021, for example, the dataset is missing 22 states. This incomplete geographic coverage limits the ability to estimate true nationwide vaccination rates and may bias comparisons across regions or over time. Additionally, the dataset is self-reported and therefore subject to recall bias."
